Concordance = shows the “Keyword in Context,” the keyword being whatever you have searched in the search bar. Similar to the “context” tab on Voyant. 

Sort —> Level 1, 2, etc. = determine which words/phrases around the keyword are highlighted (2L = two phrases to the left of the keyword, etc.)

Concordance Plot = visualizes the KWIC search, where each instance will be represented as a little black line from beginning to end of each file containing the search term. 

Clusters = displays words frequently appearing with the keyword

Collocates = finds the words which appears most frequently **accompanying the search word**
- unlike clusters, does not show words that /definitely/ appear together, but simply those that are /statistically likely/ to appear together (I think)

Keyword List = “shows comparisons between two corpora”
- “We see a list of Keywords that have words that are much more “unusual” – more statistically unexpected – in the corpus we are looking at when compared to the reference corpus.” 

# misc.  GUI (Graphical user Interface) = converts code into a more user-friendly interface, for novices 
- i.e. the Topic Modelling Tool takes MALLET (a package of java code) and converts it to be a cute little window where you click and drag instead of typing code

corpus / corpora = ??
